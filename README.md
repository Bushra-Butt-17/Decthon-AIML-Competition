# 🚀 **Decthon AIML Competition - Predictive Insights**

Welcome to the repository for the **Decthon AIML Competition**! This project utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to predict customer behavior and offer actionable insights for businesses. By analyzing customer data, we aim to improve customer engagement and optimize business strategies.

---

## 🔍 **Project Overview**

This project is designed to help businesses predict customer behavior based on historical data. By leveraging predictive modeling and segmentation, the goal is to forecast customer actions, enhance decision-making, and personalize marketing efforts.

---

## 🧑‍💻 **What We Did**

### 1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing**  
We began by cleaning and transforming raw customer data into a format suitable for machine learning. This involved:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Scaling numerical features

### 2️⃣ **Segmentation & Predictive Modeling**  
We used **segmentation techniques** to group customers based on their behavior. Then, we applied **machine learning algorithms** to predict future behaviors. This allowed us to categorize customers and forecast their likely actions.

### 3️⃣ **Model Evaluation**  
We evaluated the performance of our models using key metrics such as:
- **F1-score** ⚖️
- **Confusion Matrix** 📊
- **Classification Report** 📑

### 4️⃣ **Visualization**  
To provide deeper insights, we visualized the results:
- **Confusion Matrix** for understanding model performance
- **ROC Curve** for evaluating model discrimination ability
- **Feature Importance** to identify the most impactful factors in prediction

---

## 📊 **Key Features**

- **Customer Segmentation** 📊: Grouped customers based on similar attributes and behavior patterns.
- **Predictive Model** 🤖: Built using Random Forest, Decision Trees, or other ML models to forecast future behavior.
- **Visualization** 📈: Displayed key insights using plots and charts to help stakeholders make informed decisions.

---

## 📈 **Performance Metrics**

The model's performance was evaluated using:
- **F1-score** ⚖️: The balance between precision and recall, ensuring a reliable classification.
- **Confusion Matrix** 📉: To understand the misclassifications made by the model.
- **Classification Report** 📄: To showcase precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes.
